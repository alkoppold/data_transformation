## This is the analysis file for Team Literature 


Calculate Entrophy with an example
```{r entrophy}
City = c("Moscow", "Moscow", "Paris", "London", "London", 
         "London", "NYC", "NYC", "NYC", "NYC")
table(City)
# City
# London Moscow    NYC  Paris 
#      3      2      4      1 
entropy = function(cat.vect){
  px  = table(cat.vect)/length(cat.vect)
  lpx = log(px, base=2)
  ent = -sum(px*lpx)
  return(ent)
}
entropy(City)   
```
